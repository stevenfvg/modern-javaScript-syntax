// 1. Increment with the "++" operator:

let number = 5;
number++; // Increment by 1
console.log(number); // 6

let value = 10;
value += 2; // increment by 2
console.log(value); // 12

/* In the first example, we use the operator "++" to increment the value of the variable `number` by 1. 
In the second example, we use the compound assignment operator "+=" to increment the value of the variable `value` in 2. */

// 2. Decrement with the "--" operator:

let number2 = 8;
number2--; // Decrease by 1
console.log(number2); // 7

let value2 = 15;
value2 -= 3; // Decrease by 3
console.log(value2); // 12

/* In the first example, we use the operator "--" to decrement the value of the variable `number` by 1. 
In the second example, we use the compound assignment operator "-=" to decrement the value of the variable `value` in 3. */

/* Remember that increment and decrement can also be done in more complex expressions and with different arithmetic operators. 
Also, where the "++" or "--" operator is placed (before or after the variable) can affect the result, as they differentiate between pre-increment/post-increment and pre-decrement/post-decrement. */
